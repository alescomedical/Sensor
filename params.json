To fix this issue:\r\n  - Navigate to Platform/Linux/Build\r\n  - run 'make install-usb-rules'\r\n  - if the device was connected, unplug and reconnect it.\r\n  This part is done automatically by the install script, but you will need to do it manually if you choose not to use the automated install.\r\n* Linux: The device driver contains a thread for reading from the USB device. This thread should have high priority in order to function correctly. Each process using the device driver should have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability in order to raise thread priority. Failing to have that capability, will cause a failure in setting priority, consequently causing loss of data.\r\n* MacOSX: Only OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and above with a 64-bit Intel based CPU is currently supported.\r\n  Client/Server is not supported yet so do not attempt to access the sensor with more then one application.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nBuild Notes:\r\n------------\r\nWindows:\r\n\tRequirements:\r\n\t\t1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2010\r\n\t\t   From: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb984878.aspx\r\n\t\t2) Python 2.6+/3.x\r\n\t\t   From: http://www.python.org/download/\r\n\t\t3) PyWin32\r\n\t\t   From: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/\r\n\t\t   Please make sure you download the version that matches your exact python version.\r\n\t\t4) WIX 3.5\r\n\t\t   From: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102\r\n\t\t5) OpenNI 1.5.x.x\r\n\t\t   From: http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx\t\r\n\r\n\tOptional Requirements (To build the documentation):\r\n\t\t1) Doxygen\r\n\t\t   From: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc\r\n\t\t2) GraphViz\r\n\t\t   From: http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php\r\n\t\t   \r\n\tBuilding Sensor:\r\n\t\t1) Go to the directory: \"Platform\\Win32\\CreateRedist\".\r\n\t\t   Run the script: \"Redist.py\".\r\n\t\t   This will compile and prepare the redist exe files that includes everything.\r\n\t\t2) Install the exe you've just made which is located in Platform\\Win32\\CreateRedist\\FinalXX\\Sensor-Win32-5.x.x.x.exe\r\n\t\t   (XX being the number of bits: 32 or 64)\r\n\t\t   The installer will also automatically register all the modules into OpenNI via the NiReg utility.\r\n\t\t   \r\n\t\tThe visual studio solution is located in: Platform\\Win32\\Build\\EngineWin32.sln.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tImportant: Please note that even though the directory is called Win32, you can also use it to compile it for 64-bit targets (AMD64/x64).\r\n   \r\nLinux:\r\n\tRequirements:\r\n\t\t1) GCC 4.x\r\n\t\t   From: http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html\r\n\t\t   Or via apt:\r\n\t\t   sudo apt-get install g++\r\n\t\t2) Python 2.6+/3.x\r\n\t\t   From: http://www.python.org/download/\r\n\t\t   Or via apt:\r\n\t\t   sudo apt-get install python\r\n\t\t3) OpenNI 1.5.x.x\r\n\t\t   From: http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx\r\n\t\t   \r\n\tBuilding Sensor:\r\n\t\t1) Go into the directory: \"Platform/Linux/CreateRedist\".\r\n\t\t   Run the script: \"./RedistMaker\".\r\n\t\t   This will compile everything and create a redist package in the \"Platform/Linux/Redist\" directory.\r\n\t\t   It will also create a distribution in the \"Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/Final\" directory.\r\n\t\t2) Go into the directory: \"Platform/Linux/Redist\".\r\n\t\t   Run the script: \"sudo ./install.sh\" (needs to run as root)\r\n\r\n  \t\t   The install script copies key files to the following location:\r\n\t\t       Libs into: /usr/lib\r\n\t\t       Bins into: /usr/bin\r\n\t\t       Config files into: /usr/etc/primesense\r\n\t\t       USB rules into: /etc/udev/rules.d \r\n\t\t       Logs will be created in: /var/log/primesense\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\tTo build the package manually, you can run \"make\" in the \"Platform\\Linux\\Build\" directory.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tImportant: Please note that even though the directory is called Linux, you can also use it to compile it for 64-bit targets and pretty much any other linux based environment.\t\r\n\r\n\tBuilding Sensor using a cross-compiler:\r\n\t\t1) Make sure to define two environment variables:\r\n\t\t   - <platform>_CXX - the name of the cross g++ for platform <platform>\r\n\t\t   - <platform>_STAGING - a path to the staging dir (a directory which simulates the target root filesystem).\r\n\t\t   Note that <platform> should be upper cased.\r\n\t\t   For example, if wanting to compile for ARM from a x86 machine, ARM_CXX and ARM_STAGING should be defined.\r\n\t\t2) Go into the directory: \"Platform/Linux/CreateRedist\".\r\n\t\t   Run: \"./RedistMaker <platform>\" (for example: \"./RedistMake Arm\").\r\n\t\t   This will compile everything and create a redist package in the \"Platform/Linux/Redist\" directory.\r\n\t\t   It will also create a distribution in the \"Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/Final\" directory.\r\n\t\t3) To install OpenNI files on the target file system:\r\n\t\t   Go into the directory: \"Platform/Linux/Redist\".\r\n\t\t   Run the script: \"./install.sh -c $<platform>_STAGING\" (for example: \"./install.sh -c $ARM_STAGING\").\r\n\r\n  \t\t   The install script copies key files to the following location:\r\n\t\t       Libs into: STAGING/usr/lib\r\n\t\t       Bins into: STAGING/usr/bin\r\n\t\t       Config files into: STAGING/usr/etc/primesense\r\n\t\t       USB rules into: STAGING/etc/udev/rules.d \r\n\t\t       Logs will be created in: STAGING/var/log/primesense\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\tTo build the package manually, you can run \"make PLATFORM=<platform>\" in the \"Platform\\Linux\\Build\" directory.\r\n\t\tIf you wish to build the Mono wrappers, also run \"make PLATFORM=<platform> mono_wrapper\" and \"make PLATFORM=<platform> mono_samples\".\r\n\t\t\r\nMacOSX:\r\n\tRequirements:\r\n\t\t1) For Mac OSX 10.7, Xcode 4.3.2\r\n\t\t      From: http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action\r\n\t\t      http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_4.3.2/xcode_432_lion.dmg    \r\n   \r\n\t\t      You will also need to download and install the \"Commandline Tools for XCode -
